# Workist Task

Thanks for the opportunity to work on this task! I had a lot of fun.

- Everything is located in workist.ipynb 
- I also saved an html version of that file if you prefer to open that in a browser
- The model is too big to be directly uploaded to github and I am using an account I just created so its not itegrated in my IDE or command line GIT (which is all under my current work account).
  - You can download the trained model here if you're interested: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TitYws0zabF4D3Xw1_35NaOzWMUa3L5i/view?usp=sharing
  - Sorry for the inconvenience...I am just worried about my current employer somehow seeing the activity.
